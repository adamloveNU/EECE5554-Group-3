The shared repository for Northeastern University's EECE5554 Robotics Sensing & Navigation under Professor Dipanjan Saha. The team members are Grace Boltz, Juan Cerquera, Andrew Chen, and Adam Love.

### Project
The current idea for the project is to create a multi agent robot system, where 2 robots will be simultaneously running a SLAM algorithm using a shared map (subject to change). Each robot will be running a ROS2 package which publishes messages over a shared network to a central PC, which will store the updated map and tell each robot how to navigate. The processors used for the robots will be one raspberry pi 3B+ and one raspberry pi zero 2 w.
